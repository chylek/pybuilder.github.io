PyBuilder 0.13.0 has been released deprecating EOL Python support, stabilizing environment orchestration across all 
major platforms and migrating CI/CD to GitHub Actions.

<!--more-->

Support for Python 2.7 and 3.5 has been discontinued after runtimes having reached end-of-life and becoming 
unmaintainable.

Due to Python deprecation several plugins have also been removed due to utility abandonment.
