* `install_dependencies` task, while still available, is most likely no longer necessary as PyBuilder 0.12.x manages 
`venvs` automatically.
* it's highly recommended to run `pyb --update-project` to create `pyproject.toml` and update `setup.py`.
* Coverage 5.0+ uses sqlite to store coverage data which is now saved in `$dir_target/*.coverage`. If you have CI 
coverage analytics running you need to update the reference to the location of the coverage files.
