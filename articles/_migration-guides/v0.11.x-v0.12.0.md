# CLI and `build.py` Changes

* `install_dependencies` task, while still available, is most likely no longer necessary as PyBuilder 0.12.x manages 
`venvs` automatically.
* it's highly recommended to run `pyb --update-project` to create `pyproject.toml` and update `setup.py`.
* Coverage 5.0+ uses sqlite to store coverage data which is now saved in `$dir_target/*.coverage`. If you have CI 
coverage analytics running you need to update the reference to the location of the coverage files.

# API Changes

## ExternalCommandBuilder
Where as in 0.11.x the `ExternalCommandBuilder` constructor was

```python
class ExternalCommandBuilder(object):
    def __init__(self, command_name, project):
        self.command_name = command_name
        self.parts = [command_name]
        self.project = project
```

in 0.12.x the API now requires a `reactor` and an optional `venv` name to be able to utilize PyBuilder venv
infrastructure:

```python
class ExternalCommandBuilder(object):
    def __init__(self, command_name, project, reactor, python_env_name="pybuilder"):
        self.command_name = command_name
        self.parts = [command_name]
        self.project = project
        self.reactor = reactor
        self._env = self.reactor.python_env_registry[python_env_name]
```

## Project.home_page

The field `project.home_page` was vestigial from time immemorial and has been removed as it was not used 
to generate any distribution metadata or anywhere else for that matter.
Please use `project.url` or `project.urls` as a functioning alternative.
