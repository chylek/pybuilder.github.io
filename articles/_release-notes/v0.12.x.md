# Release Notes - Versions 0.12.x
## Version 0.12.1

*Unreleased*

## Version 0.12.0

Version 0.12.0 is a major backwards-compatible release (hence the *minor* version bump) bringing a large number of 
backwards-compatible rewrites to PyBuilder.

### Changes

#### Core
* PyBuilder now uniformly supports and tests on *Linux*, *OSX* and *Windows* for all OS-independent features.
* PyBuilder no longer has any direct dependencies and therefore doesn't pollute the Python environment it is 
installed in.
* PyBuilder now uses multiple tiers of Python Virtual ENVironments (`venvs`) to provide dependency isolation for 
PyBuilder and for different stages of the build process. The `venvs` are programmatically available to the plugins via 
the `Reactor` and are structured as follows:
  * **system** - the environment that launched the PyBuilder. Currently it is used as a seed environment for all of the
  following and is otherwise never modified:
    * **pybuilder** - this is a `venv` that is created internally inside PyBuilder `Reactor` during the initialization 
    process and is located in the `$basedir/.pybuilder/plugins` directory.
    Environments are further distinguished by Python type and version names allowing the same project to be built 
    with multiple Python flavors and versions, e.g.:
      * cpython-3.8.1.final.0
      * pypy-2.7.13.final.42

      **pybuilder** venv is used to install remote plugins and plugin dependencies used by the PyBuilder project and 
      hosts all of the tooling. 
    * `python.core` plugin is responsible for managing additional runtime `venvs`. By default PyBuilder creates the 
    following `venvs` in `$dir_target/venv`:
      * **build** - venv that is used to deploy build-time and run-time dependencies and to run unit tests.
      * **test** - venv that is used to deploy run-time dependencies only and is used for running integration tests.
* The following projects were internally vendored into PyBuilder:
  * [setuptools](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/)
  * [virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/)
  * [tailer](https://pypi.org/project/tailer/)
  * [tblib](https://pypi.org/project/tblib/)
  * [colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/)
* PyBuilder intercepts project `build.py` descriptor class loading process to reduce the number of `pip install` 
invocations. Thus dependency installations will be batched and installed lazily as much a possible reducing 
total environment preparation times.
* Offline mode allows PyBuilder to function in the absence of Internet connectivity, provided the PIP artifacts are
available in cache and/or otherwise already satisfied in the `venvs`.
* A `Remote` framework similar to Java RMI was created for PyBuilder that allows remote method invocation and 
runtime data serialization with minimal boilerplate (i.e. with automatic Proxy creation) and utilizing a single 
communication channel with no additional threads. This dramatically simplifies writing of remote tooling for PyBuilder
and guarantees that PyBuilder class loading is not affected by the remote tools.
* Windows text colorization added.
* PyBuilder now supports PEP-517, i.e. `pyproject.toml` can be both generated for the managed projects and is used 
to install PyBuilder itself from the source tree.

#### Unit Tests
All unit tests now run execute in a fresh separate process and communicate remotely with PyBuilder reporting results.
This provides full test isolation and prevents non-reproducible test results if PyBuilder loads classes that are later
unit tested.

Unit tests run in the **build** `venv` which contains build-time and run-time dependencies.

#### Integration Tests

Integration tests run in the **test** `venv` which contains run-time dependencies only. Integration tests now integrate
with `coverage` plugin when coverage is enabled.

#### Cram

Cram tests now integration with `coverage` plugin when coverage is enabled. 

#### Coverage

Coverage has been completely rewritten and converted into a pluggable infrastructure for other plugins:
* Covered code modules are no longer imported by PyBuilder and therefore coverage is never affected by it.
* Unit test, integration test, and cram plugins integrate with and request coverage.
* Coverage now only reruns the tasks that request coverage as opposed to restarting entire task chains.
* Coverage is upgraded to 5.x and therefore now uses new Coverage sqlite storage format.

#### New Plugins

* Vendorizer plugin.
* Coveralls plugin.

### Known Issues
* While, technically, PyPy is fully supported, different versions of PyPy stall/deadlock(?) for unknown reasons.  
Furthermore, PyPy has bugs related to object finalization and resultant 
[issues with sqlite in Coverage](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/928). Your mileage with PyPy may vary.
* Cram coverage registers normally but due to the way Coverage configuration is transferred between Python processes
there will be no Coverage will be recorded. This will be resolved once Coverage library is modified to not require 
a coverage config file.
* Integration test parallelization is temporarily disabled due to threading limitations of the `Remote` framework.
Sequential integration testing still works.
* While PyBuilder itself no longer requires any particular version of `PIP` or `setuptools` to function, PEP-517 doesn't
honor `pyproject.toml`'s `backend-path` [until PIP version 20.x](https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/7394). If you want
to install PyBuilder from the source tree you **must** upgrade `PIP` to at least version `20.0.0` or use `PIP` prior to 
version `19.0.0`.
