## Version 0.11.1
* The `0.11.0` metadata claimed to support python 3.2. This has been fixed.

## Version 0.11.0
* Nearly this entire release is courtesy of [arcivanov](https://github.com/arcivanov). Thanks!!!
* Introduced `reactor.execute_task_shortest_plan` API.
* Fixed an issue where a forked coverage measurement would not properly failed the build.
* unit test and coverage measurement are now library functions in an API sense.
* `pyb install` now works and acts like `setup.py install` (distutils plugin).
* PyBuilder can now be installed with `pip install git://github.com/pybuilder/pybuilder.git@<branch>`
* Forked processes (like coverage measurements) now correctly report back their errors.
* Huge improvements to coverage accuracy when building PyBuilder itself / libraries which use part of their own code in order to build, e.G. if you run library code in `build.py`.
* Branch coverage and html reports have been added to the `python.coverage` plugin.
* The `python.coverage` process will now always fork when measuring coverage, disregarding the `coverage_fork` setting. The `coverage_fork` setting is now deprecated.
* The `python.unittest` plugin will now always fork.
* Module reloading has been removed. It is no longer useful since coverage and unit tests run in separate forks.
* `unittest_runner` must now accept a positional argument which is a filelike object. Writing to this filelike object is preferred rather than using stdout/stderr.
* Introduced [teardown actions](https://github.com/pybuilder/pybuilder/issues/169). Also action ordering is now stable/guaranteed.
* Introduced optional task dependencies (as opposed to required task dependencies). With the command line switch `-x task_name` a set of optional tasks can be skipped (repeat if required). With the command line switch `--force-exclude` this can be expanded to exclude required dependencies as well (but might lead to build consistency problems).
* **Python 3.2 support has been dropped**, please upgrade to 3.3 or 3.4
* The `python.unittest` plugin now generates nUnit-style XML reports by default (these can be parsed by jenkins).
