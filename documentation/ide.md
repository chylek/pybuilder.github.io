# IDE Integration
Like Maven, *PyBuilder* was designed to be convenient to use from the command-line since the commands are very high-level.
Using an IDE integration, however, might improve your workflow and speed.

# Available IDE extensions
* [Sublime text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) plugin.  
  See the [web site on package control](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/PyBuilder)

# Available IDE integrations
* PyCharm project files can be generated by adding `use_plugin('python.pycharm')` to your build file, and then running the task `pyb pycharm_generate`

* PyDev (Eclipse) project files can be generated by adding `use_plugin('python.pydev')` to your build file, and then running the task `pyb pydev_generate`
